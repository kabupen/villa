## Libraries for Accessing Scrolls

### [vesuvius](vesuvius/)
A Python library for accessing CT scans of ancient scrolls.

### [vesuvius-c](vesuvius-c/)
A single-header C library for accessing CT scans of ancient scrolls.

---

## Dataset & Rendering Tools

### [foundation](foundation/)
Tools to build/manage scroll datasets and cloud infrastructure.

### [crackle-viewer](crackle-viewer)
A GUI tool to inspect and label ink on virtually unwrapped segments of ancient scrolls.  
Originally developed by [Julian Schilliger](https://github.com/schillij95).

### [ink-detection](ink-detection/)
The ink detection machine learning model used to win the Vesuvius Challenge 2023 Grand Prize.  
Originally developed by [Youssef Nader](https://github.com/younader) and [Luke Farritor](https://github.com/lukeboi).

## Automatic Unwrapping (Segmentation) Pipelines

### [VC3D (surface tracer)](volume-cartographer)
A semi-automatic segmentation pipeline to extract papyrus sheets from CT scans of ancient scrolls.
As of September 2025, it is the approach used by the Vesuvius Challenge team.
Developed by [Hendrik Schilling](https://github.com/hendrikschilling) and [Sean Johnson](https://github.com/bruniss) as a fork of [Volume Cartographer](https://github.com/educelab/volume-cartographer).

### [spiral fitting](https://github.com/pmh47/spiral-fitting)
A fully automatic unwrapping pipeline that fits a spiral to the CT scan.
Originally developed by [Paul Henderson](https://github.com/pmh47).

### [thaumato-anakalyptor](thaumato-anakalyptor/)
A semi-automatic segmentation pipeline to extract papyrus sheets from CT scans of ancient scrolls.  
Originally developed by [Julian Schilliger](https://github.com/schillij95).
